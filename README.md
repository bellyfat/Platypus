# Platypus

[![Faircode](https://faircode.io/product/Platypus/badge)](https://faircode.io/product/Platypus?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badgelarge&utm_campaign=Platypus)

[Live Stable Branch](https://status.ggserv.xyz)

Active online and usage monitor using websockets and Python


## Features
 - Setup script
 - Websocket-based uptime monitoring (**AOR**)
 - Auto-post to Slack when server goes offline
 - Provide live server usage statistics with web frontend
 - Simple JSON API for building apps
 - Admin interface for managing servers

## Getting Started

Please see the wiki page [Getting Started](https://github.com/gmemstr/Platypus/wiki/Getting-Started)

## Requirements
 - Python 3.x (2.x not officially supported)
 - pip
  - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
 - MariaDB or MySQL

## Running
Run `python setup.py` to set up your instance, including creating the databse and setting an admin password.

Finally you can run `python App.py` and go navigate to `127.0.0.1:8080/login` to get to the admin control panel.

To expose it to the world, I recommend using an [nginx proxy](https://www.nginx.com/resources/admin-guide/reverse-proxy/) ([example](https://gist.github.com/gmemstr/5ec861fefa8354d5b9553938325b48e9)).

You can also use Docker if you want, with the included `Dockerfile`. You will need to configure
your config before building, and use an external SQL server.
## Configuration

Master configuration (`config.json`)

| Key | Default Value | What is |
| --- | ------------- | ------- |
| enable_slackbot | false | Enable automated Slack reports |
| enable_webserver | true | Enable web frontend and API | 
| webserver_port | 8080 | Port for webserver to run on |
| slack_api_key | | [API key for Slack posting](https://github.com/slackapi/python-slackclient) |
| admin_username | admin | Username for admin interface |
| admin_password | | Password for admin interface |
| sql_user | root | SQL database username |
| sql_pass | | SQL database password |
| sql_host | localhost | SQL database host |
| sql_db | server | SQL data table |

SQL (MySQL/MariaDB)

| Key | Type | Args | What is |
| --- | ------------- | --- | ------- |
| id | int | NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT | ID of server |
| name | varchar(120) | | Name of server |
| hostname | varchar(120) | | Domain or IP of server |
| online | boolean | DEFAULT true | Caching whether server is actually online |
| ip | varchar(50) | | Used to identify servers requesting UUID registration |
| uuid | varchar(50) | | Used to identify registered servers |

```
Other notes:

 - Databse: Platypus
 - PRIMARY KEY: id
```

Node configuration (`aor_config.json`)

| Key | Default Value | What is |
| --- | ------------- | ------- |
| uuid |  | Auto-generated node unique identifier |
| masterkey | | "API" key for authentication with master server |
| master_url | | URL or IP for the master server |
| interval | 5 | Delay between sending usage statistics |


## Script

Included in the `Scripts` folder is the node-side `aor.py` script. This should be
deployed to the machines you would like to monitor, and modified to point towards
your master server. There is also a `Dockerfile` available, again you will need to modify the config (`aor_config.json`) before building (just fill out the master key and master host). You can also feel free to use your own custom script, however it has to be fully websocket compatible. See below about the data passed to the master.

### Requirements:

 - Python 3.x
 - websocket
 - psutil

`pip install websocket psutil`

### Deploying (Script)

You'll need Python 3.x installed on your nodes. Deploy `aor.py` and `aor_config.json`. You'll also want to change some values in the config file
to point towards the master, along with the master key. Your node with auto-authenticate
with the master.


### Deploying (Docker)

Edit `aor_config.json` then build the image as you normally would.
